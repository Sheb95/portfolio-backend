# My Portfolio - Backend

So... this is where I intend all for all the magic to happen. The user clicks on to the client-side of my website and is greeted by a list of my projects. But, I intend for that data to be stored on a database so that I can add more and also use it to migrate to a different frontend. For this, I am keeping it simple; an SQL database with one table (at the moment). I will make it fully CRUD one day but for now, I just need GET request to be made to an endpoint to list all projects. 

## Data Schema 

| Projects    | Data        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| id          | int         | id auto-generated by database
| title       | string      | Title of project
| thumbnail   | string      | Url of project screenshot image used as thumbnail
| github      | string      | Link to project github repo
| description | string      | Brief description of project
| url         | string (can be NULL)      | url of deployed project (if it exsits)
| isDeployed  | boolean     | Shows whether or not site is deployed (True or False) |
