         "My team and I were given a week to produce an application that solved the School of Code students' problems. One of the issues we found was access to recommended resources. Thus, we created a curated platform where students can search for resources useful to others. I led my team through the backend development of our website, created a RESTAPI using Express and PostgreSQL and deployed it on Heroku and conducted manual testing of API endpoints using Postman. ",
